* [Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go) [49 min, PyCon US 2013, [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/pyconslides/transforming-code-into-beautiful-idiomatic-python-by-raymond-hettinger-1)] – Learn to take better advantage of Python's best features and improve existing code through a series of code transformations.
* [Stop Writing Classes](http://youtu.be/o9pEzgHorH0) \[20 + 7 min, PyCon US 2012] – Python is a multi-paradigm language, and while classes are great, they are also overused. This shows real world code examples and refactors the unnecessary classes, exceptions, and modules out of them – leading to a simplification of 660 SLOC to a mere 5 SLOC in one case. But be aware of [Start Writing More Classes](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/2/13/moar-classes/).
* [A Python Æsthetic: Beauty and Why I Python](http://youtu.be/x-kB2o8sd5c) [47 min, PyCon CA 2012] – Principles of math and typesetting applied to your Python code to make it pleasing to the eye, and thus more readable and maintainable.


## The New Era

Python 3 and other ‘modern’ and/or exciting stuff…

* [Grug make fire! Grug make wheel!](http://youtu.be/UtFHIpNPMPA) [27 min, PyCon AU 2014] – A look back at the confusing history of packaging in Python, how things got better and lead to today's formats and tools for releasing Python code.
